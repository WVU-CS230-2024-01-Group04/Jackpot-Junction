      **Blackjack Game**
Blackjack, formerly known as black jack and vingt-un, is a popular casino banking game played worldwide. 
Here are some key points about the game:

**History:**

a). The gameâ€™s immediate precursor was the English game twenty-one (called vingt-un in French).

b). The first written reference to a similar game appears in a book by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.

c). In the United States, vingt-un evolved into an American variant called blackjack around 1899.

**Objective: **

The goal of blackjack is to get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it. Going over 21 results in a bust.

**Card Values:**

1. Number cards (2-10) have their face value.

2. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points each.

3. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Initial Deal:** The dealer deals two cards to each player, including themselves.
   One of the dealer's cards is dealt face down (the "hole card").
   
3. **Player's Turn:** The player goes first and can choose from the following options:
   
    **Hit:** The player receives another card. The player can continue to hit until they decide to stand or until their hand value exceeds 21 (bust).
   
   ** Stand:** The player keeps their current hand and ends their turn.
   
    **Double Down:** The player doubles their initial bet, receives one additional card, and then must stand.
   
    **Split: ** If the player's first two cards are of the same rank, they have the option to split them into two separate hands.
   
               Each hand is then played independently, with the option to hit, stand, double down, or split again.
   
5. **Dealer's Turn:** Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until their hand total is 17 or higher.
     If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust.
   
**4. Winning and Losing:**

        a). If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, the player wins.
        
        b). If the player's hand exceeds 21 (bust), they lose.
        
        c). If the player and dealer have the same hand total (push), the player's bet is returned.
        
        d). If the player gets a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) on their initial two cards, they win automatically unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, resulting in a push.

**Payouts:**

1. Winning hands are paid out at even money (1:1), except for Blackjack, which typically pays out at 3:2.

2. Doubling down pays out at 1:1 on the original bet amount.

3. Insurance (betting that the dealer has a Blackjack) pays out at 2:1.


**Slots Game**

**Overview**

This is a simple command-line based implementation of the popular casino game, Slots. 

The game allows players to simulate the experience of playing a slot machine with colorful graphics and sound effects.

**Objective:**

The objective of a slots game is to spin the reels and match symbols across one or more paylines to win prizes.

**Gameplay:**

**Place Your Bet:** Before spinning the reels, you need to place a bet.

"Spin" button. Alternatively, some slots games may offer an "Auto Spin" feature, allowing you to automatically spin the reels a set 

number of times without manual input.

**Wait for the Outcome:** After spinning the reels, wait for them to come to a stop. The symbols displayed on the reels determine the 

outcome of the spin.
